Restaurants: No one's unfamiliar with the parlous state of restaurants, forced to close to all but takeout business in much of the country.

There's a lot of magical thinking in Washington, that this is just about special people that kind of come down from on high.

It's a folk-rock waltz, with a band backing a simply strummed acoustic guitar as Petty sings with craggy resignation about deep-seated alienation and against-the-odds optimism.

College students - one of Sanders" strongest constituencies - have reported absentee ballots being sent to the wrong address or not at all, and a lawsuit has been filed that would require the state to notify voters if their mail-in ballot has been rejected due to a "mismatched signature" - one of many technicalities that can quietly disenfranchise unsuspecting citizens.

"They say they are listening to us but they are not. What they seem to want to do is punish the north. The extra financial support announced by the chancellor is welcome but it is two-thirds of people's wages, not 80% which it was before.

The community that Murray speaks of is hard to maintain when there are hardly any communal areas. Druids Heath's three pubs have all closed down: the Gladiator is now sheltered housing, the Maypole is a Halfords and the Cartland Arms a McDonald's. There might be lots of green space but there are no playgrounds. Internet access is limited; smartphones and laptops are not common.

""Outrage" is an extraordinary film to watch after the #MeToo revelation," Borden said. "Ida Lupino has always been compared to Dorothy Arzner. But she's nothing like Dorothy Arzner. And it's only because there have been so few visible women. It's an unfair comparison. Her films are so interesting! She's reflecting an inner life of women going into the '50s."
He was a vast man, even perhaps a giant, and such people were prone to early death from heart attacks - not to mention the presumably considerable stress of spending all your time thinking about the end of the world, of constantly envisioning outbreaks of incurable disease, asteroid collisions, government cover-ups, collapsing coastal shelves, total nuclear war.

From Tehran's point of view, there was a narrow range of options.

One of the easiest-looking recipes was one for sweet and sour pickled rose petals. Indeed, Treasure Trove promises that the dish will "will look nice, and it is quite easy to make."
"My teenage daughters really learned how expensive basic food and baby supplies are," Falkenhagen said of the shopping experience.

And to think about how the pandemic's unemployment would be affecting people all over the world that were struggling with providing the basics for their families."
Iran's government was under tremendous political pressure to respond to Soleimani's death.

Pemberton is the only farmer I've ever met. And therefore the only vlogging farmer I've ever met. He runs a highly successful YouTube channel called Tom Pemberton Farm Life, which he started three years ago as a way to publicise his dad's farm shop.

He is also one of six Australian keepers with more than a thousand Test runs, currently on 1,403. Another 25 will take him past Bert Oldfield, with 80 innings to Paine's 51. From there Paine would trail only Brad Haddin, Rod Marsh, Ian Healy and Gilchrist, each of whom batted over a hundred times.
Norman has a message for those conspiracy theorists still doubting the validity of the pandemic, telling Seven: "Get a life, understand the facts and reality. This is real."
Wikipedia is now such a ubiquitous part of online life that it's hard to remember how strange the project seemed at first.

SAUL I personally plan to vote by mail this year, mostly because I think I'll be busy on Election Day. It's important to read the mail ballot carefully and follow the instructions. Fill in the ovals or squares. In other words - no check marks or X marks within the ovals or squares. Don't make stray marks on the ballots. On one uncounted ballot in Georgia, the voter placed hearts by preferred candidates. Don't make erasures.

Megahits like "Breaking Bad," "The Sopranos," and "Mad Men" made the cut, yet other runaway successes like "Game of Thrones" are absent.

This is why we demand to be given UCAS-predicted grades because they have been done by our former teachers or tutors who have knowledge of our capabilities.

This will be followed by vaccination centers, which he said were being set up now, before a "community rollout" including doctors' offices and pharmacists.

The model showed that the susceptibility has to be unrealistically different between age groups if they assume age does not influence severity and mortality.

However, I am aware that interest-only loans have become harder to get and the lender may charge you a higher interest rate.

Dams, solar, wind and other renewable energy sources must replace our reliance on dirty fossil fuels. Although the green energy revolution is undeniably urgent, however, we cannot talk about "clean" energy while communities like those Cáceres defended are militarised and displaced, and while community leaders continue to be jailed and killed.

Not quite. Schools regulator Ofqual will still determine when valid mock results can be used. Students wanting such results to hold sway over moderated grades will still have to go through an appeal process, with their school required to submit evidence to the exam board.

The commercial was filmed in early January and made by volunteers (Ms. Schaefer put out a call for help on Instagram).

There was that brief, fleeting period of time in 2017, when many of us who support progressive causes -- from a woman's right to make decisions about her own body to the urgent need to address climate change -- hoped and even believed that she would be the savior.

Manual scavenging is not just a caste-based but also a gender-based occupation. Of the 1.2 million manual scavengers in India, about 95% of them are women.

Mistakes become harder to correct with every passing second, and by the time she tucked that box under her desk with no protest from you, her error had become your reality.

Fancourt mentions film sets in the US, where entire casts and crews are agreeing to isolate for two weeks before a shoot.

It used to be that a new movie by Werner Herzog was an anticipated event; these days it's more of an "Oh, another one." Herzog sure seems to be churning them out. His latest, Family Romance, LLC, is his sixth feature in four years. Pretty impressive for a 77-year-old, but as well as the worry that he is spreading himself too thinly, is there a danger that Herzog is becoming a brand?
Clearly that's not an issue for now, so I can write freely about all of the million-plus emotions I'm feeling. I spend most of my writing time exhaustively analysing every word I type, thinking about how any person who might read it will receive it and then deleting it and starting from the beginning.

We loved La Redoute's twinkle printed cotton tablecloth for its unusual colourway.

It's been a shocker of a year. I've not seen some of my favourite people IRL since February. The only new pals I've made are my houseplants.

It is often forgotten, for example, that Veron started well enough back in 2001 to win the top-flight's Player of the Month award for September. His performance in a 4-1 win over Everton was so impressive, it led the suspended Nicky Butt to believe that his own United career was effectively over. And even once Veron began to struggle, he was inconsistent rather than downright poor. He still played a significant part in the title-winning 2002-03 campaign.
Many began to feel that they had not been reunited with their Western cousins, but instead had been taken over by them. They complained of Westerners disparaging their achievements and disdaining their educations as subpar.

They mourned the loss of predictability, while all too often forgetting the constraints and repression of communism.

With its delicate taste and light amber colouring, this honey is an absolute treat. The subtle hints of citrus give a gentle tang without being overpowering, and the floral undertones are fresh and punchy.

You'll notice a few more vegetarian dishes on this page in the coming months, as it's good to take a break from meat and enjoy the delicious taste of fruit and vegetables.
"When you realize what the supply chain looks like and the number of hands that touch these flowers, and then they're only appreciated for a couple of hours, it's kind of disgusting when you think about the amount of resources that go into it," says Jennifer Grove, founder of New York City-based flower service Repeat Roses.
"If - and this is really the worst, worst case of all - if I no longer have any money to buy feed, or if it should happen that my feed supplier is no longer able to deliver due to new restrictions, then I would slaughter animals to feed other animals," the director, Verena Kaspari, was quoted as saying.

As a result, the significant ethical questions and concerns were not really addressed by parliament. Moreover, most MSPs seemed to be somewhat gullible in their ­compassion when a simple solution to increase the number of organs available for transplantation was presented (a solution that would have been implemented decades ago had it not been associated to real ethical concerns).
With his chubby hands clutching his foe's facemask, Reid had leaned back and had the quarterback bent over at the waist and wind-milling his arms.
Your body already has a cannabinoid system that uses the chemicals your body naturally produces. CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) both work by using this natural system. In total, there are at least 113 cannabinoids that have been discovered in cannabis. THC is the most famous one because it is the component in cannabis that gets you high. Unlike THC, CBD and other cannabinoids do not have psychoactive properties.
The family then had to wait 24 hours for the body because an elevator in the hospital broke down. Mr. Khairwar, an accountant who just lost his job, wants to get his whole family tested, to see if they have been infected.

For instance, the two biggest U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, had a combined 625,000 in requests for $80 billion in loans as of Tuesday. But because the companies are relying on armies of employees to manually take in customers' information, verify loan amounts and input data into the SBA system, only a small fraction of that has actually been paid out so far, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

The video of the watermelon slicing method went viral on TikTok, with over 37 million views and 1.2 million likes. Apart from being quick and easy, the video of the hack was also mesmerising to watch. What the user did was that he made semi-circular incisions on either side of the watermelon. Then, he made one long horizontal cut across the surface, thus splitting it into two. The watermelon pieces could then be separated and eaten, piece by piece.
But, he continues, his baritone voice rising a notch, it's possible "to see those prejudices overcome and to do it in a way that brings more and more people along."

Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York echoed that thought: "It's not good enough to hear about what's in the bill," she tweeted just before it was released. "Members of Congress need to see & read the bills we are expected to vote on.

"Medicare for All is inevitable. It is a matter of when, not if. That's because the current system, with private health insurers being the gatekeepers to care for millions of Americans, is collapsing," Wendell Potter, a former private health insurance executive who now advocates for major health care reform, told Newsweek. "The reason voters rank health care as their top issue and support Medicare for All is because they are feeling more and more financial distress."

As busy parents, we also want to focus on easy dressing, so double zips with zip guards to protect little chins and smooth lining in the arms are a must. Then it's all about protection and warmth - so integrated feet and fold back mittens make keeping little hands and toes toasty and fuss-free.

According to him, Sam knew the quality of man he was before his death and that would be a relief to the family, even as he prayed God to keep his family and children and give everyone the heart to bear the loss.
Another issue is the incomplete picture officials have of where lead pipes are located.

It was a firm and well placed shot to Dominic Cummings. It left the route open for his return, but certainly only after Mr Cummings has departed.

He wanted the league to grow under his watch, and it did. He wanted the game to grow internationally, and it did. He wanted players to dress more professionally, and the pregame show in locker rooms now is akin to a fashion show. He was a basketball tour de force, doing it in suits and wing-tips instead of jerseys and sneakers, and unquestionably is why the league is so successful today.
About 40% of enslaved Africans brought to North America came through the port city of Charleston, which in 2018 issued a formal apology for its role in the slave trade. In its resolution, the city said the statue, in place since 1898, "is seen by many people as something other than a memorial to the accomplishments of a South Carolina native, but rather a symbol glorifying slavery and as such, a painful reminder of the history of slavery in Charleston."

Certainly, the medicine will be in the sphere of our closest and priority attention," Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said.

Second, a huge portion of executive compensation isn't actually guaranteed: the CEOs don't get all the money cited in the companies" proxy reports unless they meet certain performance targets or remain in the job past a certain date.

As a kid he played a street urchin in a Metropolitan Opera production of "La Bohème" as well as the redolently named Tommy Manicotti in the sitcom "The Honeymooners." After relocating to Los Angeles in the 1960s, he harnessed his lifelong love of the piano to begin writing songs.

So revolutionary was this medical miracle - this harvesting of a serum that could cure humans of the disease - that it earned its creator, the German physiologist Emil von Behring, the first Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1901.

She said: 'I can only apologise for not noticing the heart - I am so sorry. My conclusion was Clayton likely had an on going chest infection. I didn't specifically look at the heart but I did look at his lungs. I think the obvious point now when I look at any imaging that I don't let a previous diagnosis cloud my assessment. I have changed my practice and document even the negative findings and make sure to document everything.
Our thinking about having your story heard correlates with research on narrative approaches in various fields, including medicine and economics. Many studies show how art can help structure experiences like illness, even when that experience seems to lack structure. Experiential psychology provides ample evidence that "how we see the world" is as important as "how the world is." So, the activity of storytelling can itself make an impact on how we see the world.
"The fraternities are breeding grounds for politicians, for banks - the people with power still mainly come from those places," said Michael Leendertse, the head of development for Ares.

"He has endangered our national security. He ripped families apart. He poisoned the Census. He has personally profited from his office. He has attacked our elections and sought to throttle democracy. He was rightly impeached by the House of Representatives. He has engaged in treachery, in treason. He has all but given up on governing and protecting our nation and if he had a shred of dignity he would resign today," wrote Pascrell.
For booksellers, most of them outside New York, the convention was a rare opportunity to get to know others in the industry - a place to network, meet publishers and authors face-to-face and plan their fall book purchases.

An appeal for handball against Gabriel was waved away before, on the brink of half-time, Willian's pass was cut out and West Ham, suddenly unshackled, burst forwards. Tomas Soucek galloped into space, laid the ball off for Ryan Fredericks on the overlap, and Antonio stretched and diverted the cross into the far corner.

Central to this book is the ongoing dispute regarding which mental illnesses can be attributed to physical abnormalities within the brain and which originate in the mind, or consciousness. The authors emphasise that in many cases we still cannot be sure. But they mine the question vividly and knowledgeably through the history of two ailments - hysteria and syphilis - and the long battle to define and treat them. Along the way, their investigations exhume some unforgettable scenes and characters.

Thistlewood hoped that at least 50 followers would turn up to help when they gathered in a loft above a dilapidated stable in Cato Street off Edgware Road. But on the night only 20 men arrived. Alarmed at how few of them there were, some attempted to back out, but others started to distribute swords, clubs and muskets provided by Edwards. Desperately, Thistlewood told them: "For God's sake, do not think of dropping the business now."
A tech-obsessed 21-year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall's swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social life to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at 3pm on a Friday.
How nurses and midwives were viewed was imported almost without adaptation from Europe. For example, in France nurses are still perceived as a handmaiden to the doctor, with very little independent practice. Midwives are almost unknown. The severe shortage of midwives in many African countries speaks to the continuing dominance of non-applicable models in African health services.
The same can also be said for Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), who this week we see trying to rob a virtual bank with her new side-kick Caleb (Aaron Paul) in a high-stakes sequence that radiates an Olympic pools-worth of adrenaline into a scene that...consists of three people sat at a desk, talking.

Franklin Mieuli, the Warriors" owner at the time, drafted Rife in the 13th round. It was a publicity stunt, and the pick was nullified. But Mieuli formed a four-team women's league in the Bay Area.

The Emmys had the relative advantage of following a handful of socially distanced awards shows, including the BET Awards and the VMAs, as well as the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, which combined pre-recorded segments with live content.

Just not that perfect little/big body anymore."

Pollock actually serves as the movie's (frequently used) narrator, and he's a folksy natural, adding literary authenticity to director Antonio Campos' film. Yet other than attracting an inordinately good lineup of players -- many in relatively minor roles -- the dutiful nature of the adaptation drains much of the life out of the movie.
And "The Lanyard" by Billy Collins is a touchstone in our family. In fact, when I dropped our then-10-year-old son off at summer camp for the first time, it was with one request (besides have a great time): Could he make me a lanyard? He delivered. It was blue and red, and I loved it.

Although I suspect their aims may be less noble - as one mate told me, keeping houseplants alive is an easy way of signalling to the opposite sex that you "have your shit together."

"In New York, I wasn't happy," Jamal said in a recent interview with The Seattle Times. "When you're trying to do something out of the norm, it's hard to please everybody. I was over it, man. I wasn't happy, and I knew I wasn't happy, and I had to take a chance."

Food waste costs the United States an estimated $218 billion annually, while costing the globe nearly $940 billion, according to the EPA and UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

Well, his wife Wendy [played by Laura Linney] is equally evil, if not more. There's the poppy growers, what's their name? The Snells, that's who they are.

"However, I think his conduct has a wider impact.
