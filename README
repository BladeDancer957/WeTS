# WeTS: A Benchmark for Translation Suggestion
========================

Translation Suggestion (TS), which provides alternatives for specific words or phrases given the entire documents translated by machine translation (MT) has been proven to play a significant role in post editing (PE). WeTS is a benchmark data set for TS, which is annotated by expert translators. WeTS contains corpus(train/dev/test) for four different translation directions, i.e., English2German, German2English, Chinese2English and English2Chinese.
